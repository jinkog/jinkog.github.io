Why Statistics? A core activity in science is collecting data to develop 
and evaluate theories about the way things work.
To explore research questions, we design studies and then 
look at the resulting data to find meaning in the context of randomness.
Statistics is the science of learning from data, and
provides a principled framework and powerful set of methods to help 
with study design, modelling and analysis.
I use statistics to understand inherited traits and patterns,
while accounting for the way the data have been sampled, 
their randomness and dependencies. A central theme of my research is how DNA 
sequence variation reflects the many ways in which we are related. 
These relationships are often hidden and can tell us about our ancestry and origins.
They have many uses including forensics (genetic genealogy), agricultural breeding,
plant and wildlife conservation and 
genomic mapping in pursuit of disease treatments.
Another research theme is integrating high-throughput and traditional clinical
data to refine phenotypes and better discern patterns of disease inheritance.
However, with big data come issues in statistical interpretation. For example:
How do we design our research study to get the most information for our efforts?
What are the sources of variation and of bias in our data?
How do we tease apart the data patterns
that are relevant from the ones that arise by chance, or through
unrecognized biases in our sampling? 
<p>
If you have interests
in statistics and computing and share a curiousity about
genetics and biology, please consider <a href=http://stat.sfu.ca/grad/brochure.html>applying</a>
for graduate studies at SFU. I welcome
